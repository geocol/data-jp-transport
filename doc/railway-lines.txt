railway-lines.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file contains lines of railways in Japan and stations on those
lines.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object, whose names are line identifiers and
values are corresponding properties.

Line identifiers are strings identifying railway lines.  The Wikipedia
reference of the Wikipedia article in which the line is described is
used as the line identifier of the line.

Values are JSON objects with following name/value pairs:

  names [object]

    Known formal or informal names of the line.  Names of the object
    are names and values of the object are boolean true values.

  stations

    A JSON array of stations in the line, if known.  Stations are
    sorted in some order, but might not reflect actual geographical
    order of the stations (e.g. when there are multiple branch lines).

    Stations are represented as JSON objects with following name/value
    pairs:

      abandoned [boolean]

        Whether the station has been abandoned or not.

      name [string]

        The name of the station.

      wref [string?]

        The Wikipedia reference of the description of the station, if
        known and is different from |name|'s value.
