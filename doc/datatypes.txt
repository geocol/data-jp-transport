Data types used in data files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Common data types are described in
<https://github.com/manakai/data-web-defs/blob/master/doc/data-types.txt>.

A Wikipedia reference is a short string used to identify a Wikipedia
page and/or section, as used in Wikipedia's [[...]] notation.  For
example:

  Hoge Fuga      - Wikipedia page whose name is "Hoge Fuga"
  Hoge#Fuga      - Wikipedia section "Fuga" in page "Hoge"
  #Fuga          - Wikipedia section "Fuga" in some base page

When a Wikipedia reference without page name is used, a way to
determine the base page for the reference must be described somewhere.

Unless otherwise stated, the Wikipedia references identify pages
and/or sections in Japanese version of Wikipedia
<http://ja.wikipedia.org/>.
