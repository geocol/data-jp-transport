region-lines.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file contains list of active railway lines in regions in Japan.

* Structure

The file contains a JSON object whose names are region codes and
values are JSON objects containing list of lines.  Names of objects
are Wikipedia references of lines and values are "weight" numbers.

Region codes are codes (全国地方公共団体コード) of prefectures,
non-designated cities, wards, towns, and villages (都道府県市区町村、た
だし政令指定都市を除く。) in Japan.  Regions which have no open
station are omitted.  See
<https://github.com/geocol/data-jp-areas/blob/master/data/jp-regions.json>
for the mapping of regions and their codes.

Weights can be used to sort lines by "significance" in the region.
Greater values are more "significant".  The values theirselves should
not be considered important.
